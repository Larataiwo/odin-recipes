    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The best grilled chicken breasts you'll ever make begin with a basic marinade and end with the best technique for perfect cooking, complete with beautifully-executed grill marks.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup honey</li>
        <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup oyster sauce</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>Lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 (12 ounce) pork tenderloins</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make marinade: Whisk together honey, soy sauce, oyster sauce, brown sugar, ginger, ketchup, garlic, parsley, onion powder, cayenne pepper, and cinnamon in a medium bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag.</li>
        <li>Combine ground beef, breadcrumbs, 1 tablespoon chili crisp, salt, and the 1/2 cup shredded apple in a bowl. Shape into 4 (1/2-inch-thick) patties, 4 inches in diameter. Mixture may be wet so be sure to tightly pack patties.</li>
        <li>Oil the grill grate. Grill patties, covered, carefully turning halfway through, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into centers of patties reads 160 degrees F (71 degrees C), 10 to 13 minutes. Grill onion slices, turning halfway through, 8 to 10 minutes. Grill apple slices, turning halfway through, 4 to 5 minutes. If you like, grill buns, cut sides down, until toasted, 1 to 2 minutes. When onions are cool enough to handle, separate rings.</li>
        <li>Stir mayonnaise and remaining 2 teaspoons chili crisp together in a small bowl. Spread buns with mayonnaise mixture and fill with patties, onion, and apple slices. Serve with additional chili crisp</li>
    </ol>
